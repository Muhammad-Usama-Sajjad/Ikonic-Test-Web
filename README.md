I have completed the task. First, I created the HTML code and then developed a custom theme on my localhost. After that, I uploaded the HTML to a WordPress page by creating a template and made the code dynamic using the Advanced Custom Fields plugin.
I've attached all files, including the complete WordPress backup, custom theme, and HTML code. Please review these and let me know your feedback.
